# 🧠 Kubernetes Scheduling & Placement Strategies

This repo contains concise, example-driven YAML files that simplify key Kubernetes concepts: node and pod placement using selectors, affinity/anti-affinity rules, and real-world scheduling logic. Ideal for interview prep or visual explanations in content creation.

## 📁 File Breakdown

| 📄 Filename                | 🔍 Purpose                                                                 |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `01-node-selector.yaml`    | 🎯 Assign pods to nodes with explicit labels using `nodeSelector`            |
| `02-node-selector.yaml`    | 🧪 Variant example to reinforce `nodeSelector` mechanics                     |
| `03-node-affinity.yaml`    | ❤️ Use `requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution` for strict node affinity |
| `04-node-anti-affinity.yaml` | 🚫 Avoid scheduling pods on certain nodes using node anti-affinity        |
| `05-pod-affinity.yaml`     | 🤝 Co-locate pods for communication or proximity (e.g., cache + app)         |
| `06-pod-anti-affinity.yaml` | ⚖️ Distribute pods to avoid single-point failure (e.g., replicas across zones) |
| `07-use-case.yaml`         | 🧩 Combine multiple placement rules to reflect production-grade deployment   |

## 🚀 Quick Mnemonic

Here's a mnemonic to simplify these concepts:
🧠 N.A.P.S.U = NodeSelector, Affinity, PodSelector, Spread, Use-case

- `N` = 🎯 nodeSelector — direct label match
- `A` = ❤️ Affinity — prefer or require certain nodes
- `P` = 🤝 PodAffinity — place pods together
- `S` = ⚖️ PodAntiAffinity — separate replicas across nodes
- `U` = 🧩 Use-case — real-world combination of strategies

## 🔗 When to Use What?

| Strategy              | When to Use                                               |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `nodeSelector`        | When placement is simple and label-driven                 |
| `nodeAffinity`        | For complex node conditions (preferred vs required)       |
| `podAffinity`         | Co-locating collaborating services (e.g., app ↔ cache)    |
| `podAntiAffinity`     | High availability with distributed replicas               |
